## Marvel at the Marvels! 🦸🏽‍♂️🦸🏽‍♀️

Marvel Comics App is a dynamic web app designed to explore and discover information about characters and comics from the Marvel universe. While the codebase is still a work in progress, the project showcases key functionalities and features that make it an exciting Marvel-themed experience.

## The Marvel Journey 🌟

### Cool Upgrades Coming Soon 🚀

- **Faster than Quicksilver**: The app will soon be zippier than ever, with improved response speed.

- **Flexibility Across Devices**: Get ready for a snazzy responsive design, making it look good on any screen size.

- **Cookies, Anyone?**: I am planning to add cookie storage for that personalized touch and seamless user experience.

### Easy Peasy Navigation 🗺️

- **Homepage Awesomeness**: Land on the homepage, hit the "Enter" button, or just click on those hero images to get started.

- **Double Trouble Page Lists**: There are two lists – one for characters and another for comics, fetching data from the Le Reacteur Marvel API (https://lereacteur-marvel-api.netlify.app/).

- **Flip Through Pages**: Each Page List displays results 100 by 100 in alphabetical order. Users can navigate between pages using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, with appropriate disabling when at the first or last page.

- **Search Like a Pro**: Find your favorite comics or characters using the Search Bar on each Page List.

- **Card**: Every card in the Page List contains the name or title, a picture, and two buttons—one to access detailed information and another to add the item to the Favorites Page.

### Page Details 🕵🏽‍♀️

- **Character Chronicles**: Learn all about a character's name, picture, story (if available), and the list of comics they appear in.

- **Comic Capers**: For comics, get the title, picture, and a snappy synopsis if we got one.

### Favorites Page Magic ✨

- **Local Storage Magic**: Your favorite picks are saved in local storage, so they'll always be there.

- **Delete Options:**: Delete a single comic or character with the Infinity Gems icon or clear them all with the "Empty Favorites List" button.

- **Details on Demand**: On the Favorites page, you can check out the details of your comics or characters.

### Oops! 404 Page 🤷🏽‍♀️

In case you stumble on a non-existent route, I'll gracefully guide you back home.

### Pop of Color Inspired by Marvel 🌈

My CSS is inspired by the vibrant colors of Marvel superheroes, making the app a visual delight.

## What's Next? 🚀

- **Flashy Speeds**: I am working on making the app faster than a speeding bullet.

- **Lookin' Good Everywhere**: Soon, the app will look cool on any device you fancy.

- **Cookie Storage Surprise**: Get ready for a sprinkle of cookies to enhance your experience.
